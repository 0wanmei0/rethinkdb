For full utilization of the drive, the IO controller must support AHCI
and NCQ, and AHCI must be enabled in the BIOS. Then, searching for NCQ
in dmesg should result in:

[    2.550267] ata6.00: 156301488 sectors, multi 1: LBA48 NCQ (depth 31/32)

Searching for pio/PIO in dmesg should return nothing, and searching
for ahci/AHCI should return results.
