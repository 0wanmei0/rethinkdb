-- A NOTE ON OPERATIONAL SEMANTICS

-- *Execution*

-- The language can be treated as declarative (i.e. specify which data
-- you want and let the system figure out how to do query execution),
-- and operational (i.e. if treated literally the user specifies to
-- the database exactly what to do). For the first version of
-- RethinkDB we will execute the AST depth first and as is, without
-- doing any optimizations (i.e. reordering, common subexpression
-- elimination, various join algorithms, etc). After 1.2. is out we
-- will start adding various optimizations. However, at any point the
-- user can tell the database to execute the query as is, in which
-- case no optimizations will be performed on the query.

-- *Indexing*

-- The one part of the language that does not specify operational
-- semantics is selection of data. The user cannot express in this
-- language which indexes to use. For 1.2. we will support a small set
-- of cases that optimize the selectors (e.g. point queries over a
-- primary key). We can also add porcelain commands that could be
-- compiled to this language, but are guaranteed to use certain
-- indexes (e.g. for point queries).

-- *Concurrency*

-- We will make an effort to provide atomicity on row level, however,
-- this is difficult to do in some cases, in which case we'll drop row
-- atomicity. We will not provide any cross-row atomicity or isolation
-- (though in practice, we'll end up using snapshots on a shard
-- level).

-- *Scope*

-- Some queries (such as ModQuery.Each and ExQuery.CrossEach) involve
-- having inner scopes. We will allow the user to refer to attributes
-- by name (in which case we'll search the scope from inside to
-- outside). We'll also allow users to refer to attributes by
-- qualifying them with table names (in which case we'll search the
-- scope inside to outside). We'll also allow the users to rename rows
-- to let them handle ambiguities manually.
