There are different credentials involved in working with EC2:

First there is the login into the EC2 console. Specifically, this is what you
need for logging in at https://console.aws.amazon.com/. It consists of an e-mail
address and password. The console login is only useful for human access and is
needed to check and change billing data or to manually see which nodes are
running. The console can also be used to configure key pairs and security
groups (more about these later). None of the automated scripts require these
credentials though.

Current login data for the EC2 console:
e-mail: daniel@rethinkdb.com
password: 

Automated access by scripts on the other hand is based on an access key. Access
keys can be generated from the EC2 console (go to Account -> Security
Credentials). They consist of an access key ID and a secret access key. Both 
values must be reflected in the file test/cloud_retester.py, which provides the
global configuration variables testing_nodes_ec2_access_key (this is where the
key ID goes) and testing_nodes_ec2_private_key (for the secret key).

Currently the following access key is used:
key ID: AKIAJUKUVO6J45QRZQKA
secret key: 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

To allocate nodes in EC2, an image is required. Each image has an id, which must
be put to the testing_nodes_ec2_image_name variable in test/cloud_retester.py.
In addition to the image, the following things are required: an SSH key pair and
a security group. Bot must be created once using the EC2 console and are
addressed by a name. The key pair's and security group's name must be provided
in the testing_nodes_ec2_key_pair_name and testing_nodes_ec2_security_group_name
variables in test/cloud_retester.py. Security groups specify which network ports
are accessible on the corresponding nodes. cloud retester requires port 22 (SSH)
to be accessible from the outside. To get SSH access to a node, it uses the
private key of the SSH key pair and a provided user name. The private SSH key
must be stored to a file and that file's path must be specified in the
private_ssh_key_filename variable in test/cloud_retester.py. The user name to
use depends on the image. Amazon's default Linux images use a user named
"ec2-user". The user name must be specified in
testing_nodes_ec2_image_user_name.

(the following data is for the us-east-1 location)
The following image is currently used: ami-2272864b
The following key pair is currently used:
key pair name: cloudtest_default
location of private key: test/east_ec2_private_key.pem
The following security group is used: cloudtest_default

Please note that image ids, key pairs and security groups are local to each EC2
location. So if you want to switch to another location (e.g. from us-east-1 to
us-west-1), make sure to create an appropriate key pair and security group on
that location using the EC2 console and to reflect the new image id as well as
the names of the key pair and the security group in the variables
testing_nodes_ec2_image_name, testing_nodes_ec2_key_pair_name and
testing_nodes_ec2_security_group_name in test.cloud_retester.py and place the
private key of the new key pair in the location specified by the variable
private_ssh_key_filename.
