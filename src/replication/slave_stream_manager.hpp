/* slave_stream_manager_t manages the connection to the master. Here's how it works:
The run() function constructs a slave_stream_manager_t and attaches it to a cond_t.
It also attaches a cond_weak_ptr_t to the cond_t. Then it waits on the
cond_t. If the connection to the master dies, the cond_t will be pulsed. If
it needs to shut down the connection for some other reason (like if the slave got a
SIGINT) then it pulses the cond, and the slave_stream_manager_t automatically closes
the connection to the master. */
