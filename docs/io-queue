The depth of AIO queue (i.e. number of outstanding requests before
io_submit returns -EAGAIN) is equal to min(nrevents, nr_requests),
where nrevents is passed to io_setup, and nr_requests can be found in
/sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests.

/proc/sys/fs/aio-nr is supposed to report the number of aio requests
currently being processed in the system. However, it looks to report
the reserved space of the aio context queue, which might be larger
than the number of active events (possibly peak numbers of events on
that queue).
