The depth of AIO queue (i.e. number of outstanding requests before
io_submit returns -EAGAIN) is equal to min(nrevents, nr_requests),
where nrevents is passed to io_setup, and nr_requests can be found in
/sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests.

The number of aio requests currently being processed can be checked by
reading /proc/sys/fs/aio-nr.
