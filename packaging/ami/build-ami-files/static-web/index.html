    <p>
        There are two steps to complete before this instance is
        usable. First, the SSL certificate must be accepted by your
        browser to enable encryption. Second, a password needs to be set
        to secure the instance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visit <a href="http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/todo/ami">RethinkDB.com</a>
        for more documentation on the RethinkDB AMI.
    </p>
    <p>
        To encrypt your session, a new self-signed certificate has been
        generated for this instance. This certificate is perfectly safe
        but it cannot be automatically verified by your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you press <emph>Continue</emph> your browser will warn you
        that the certificate could not be verified. If you use Chrome or
        Firefox, follow the instructions below to add an exception.
