echo "The canonical workload emulates a \"typical\" combination of both read and write commands.
echo "Commands are issued to the database with the following frequency in randomized order:"
echo "1 delete, 4 updates, 8 inserts, 64 reads"
echo "(Read: For each delete, there are 4 update / 8 insert / 64 read operations)"
echo "The workload involves keys of sizes between 8 to 16 bytes with corresponding values of sizes between 8 and 128 bytes."
echo ""
echo "[h]Rationale[/h]"
echo "The canonical workload reveals the performance of a database under a mixed workload, and provides a one-stop figure for overall database performance under \"typical\" conditions."

echo "[h]Notes about the results[/h]"
echo "Both MySQL and Membase provide stable performance at around 200k-300k queries per second."
echo "RethinkDB starts at more than 1.2M qps and manages a stable throughput of about 900k qps when the database grows in size."
