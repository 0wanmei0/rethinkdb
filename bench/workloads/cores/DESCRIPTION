echo "[h]Overview[/h]"
echo "This benchmark shows the database throughput under a varying number of available CPU cores."
echo "Please note that only 12 of the up to 24 cores are physical CPU cores, while the remaining 12 are only logical cores (due to the use of HyperThreading enables CPUs)."
echo "We run a canonical workload (mixed reads and writes) against the database server."
echo ""
echo "[h]Rationale[/h]"
echo "Measuring the core scalability of a database systems reveals concurrency bottlenecks such as global locks as well as caching and data locality issues."
echo ""
echo "[h]Notes about the results[/h]"
echo "Membase results are not available due to limitations in our benchmarking process."
echo "Both MySQL and RethinkDB show a steady performance behavior with an increasing number of cores. RethinkDB does a better job in this benchmark when it comes to turning additional cores into increased througput."
