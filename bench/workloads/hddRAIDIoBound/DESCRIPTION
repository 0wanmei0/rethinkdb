echo "[h]Overview[/h]"
echo "This benchmark runs a canonical workload (mixed read and write operations) under high cache pressure with the backstore being located on rotational hard drives."
echo "We employ four hard drives for this benchmark. MySQL accesses the hard drives through a hardware RAID controller, configured in striping mode. For RethinkDB we rely on RethinkDB's inbuilt striping mechanisms."
echo ""
echo "[h]Rationale[/h]"
echo "While not a focus point for RethinkDB, running a database on rotational hard drives might occasionally be necessary. Rotational hard drives show performance characteristics which are largely different from SSD, with decent contiguous read and write throughput but very high overheads for random access."
