echo "[h]Overview[/h]"
echo "This benchmark runs a canonical workload (mixed read and write operations) under high cache pressure with the backstore being located on SSD."
echo "We employ four Intel SSD for this benchmark. MySQL accesses the disks through a hardware RAID controller, configured in striping mode. For RethinkDB we rely on RethinkDB's inbuilt striping mechanisms."
echo ""
echo "[h]Rationale[/h]"
echo "For large data sets the out-of-cache performance becomes increasingly important. This benchmark provides insights about how well different database systems behave under cache pressure, when performance becomes almost entirely I/O bound."
echo ""
echo "[h]Notes about the results[/h]"
echo "While MySQL benefits from the different performance characteristics of SSD when compared to rotational drives and provides approximately a two-fold imrpovement in throughput figures, only RethinkDB is able to take full advantage in this benchmark, provising more than ten times the performance of a comparable HDD based performance test."
