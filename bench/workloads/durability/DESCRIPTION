echo "[h]Notes about the results[/h]"
echo "Due to limitations in RethinkDB's current implementation and it's transaction log free architecture, RethinkDB is unable to provide performance figures on-par with MySQL for this workload under strong durability requirements. Future improvements to RethinkDB will provide significant improvements in this area."
