Each folder contains a specific set of benchmarks / workloads. The full_bench
script uses all folders existent in this directory automatically.

The files in the folders are used as follows:
- Setup: Run at the start of a workload, before any R* script is run
- R*: Files that start with an R are run after Setup in alphabetical order.
        Please use a number prefix, e.g. R10workload1, R20workload2 etc. to
        ensure that the correct execution order is observed.
- Teardown: Run after all R* scripts have finished

The following environment variables are guaranteed to be set:
    SSD_DRIVES
    HDD_DRIVES
    BENCH_DIR
    DATABASE (rethinkdb, mysql or membase)
    SERVER_HOSTS

The working directory is dbench.

The file $BENCH_DIR/environment can be used to pass an execution environment.
If generated by the Setup or another script, the file gets executed though Bash
before each subsequent run of R* and Teardown scripts of the current workload.
