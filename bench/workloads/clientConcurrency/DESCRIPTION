echo "This benchmark shows the database throughput under a varying number of concurrent clients / network connections."
echo "We run a canonical workload (mixed reads and writes) against the database server."
echo ""
echo "[h]Rationale[/h]"
echo "Measuring the concurrent client scalability of a database systems reveals concurrency bottlenecks such as global locks."
echo ""
echo "[h]Notes about the results[/h]"
echo "MySQL shows an increasing throughput for up to 64 clients, and keeps on a stable level for up to 128 concurrent clients. Starting at 192 clients, its total throughput drops severely. We have not measured MySQL performance for more than 1024 concurrent clients, as MySQL reaches its scalability limits much earlier."
echo "Membase on the other hand provides a steady performance for the measured range of client concurrency (up to 16K)."
echo "RethinkDB shows a very slight performance degradation for more than 768 clients, but maintains an excellent performance level within the measured range of up to 16K concurrent clients."
