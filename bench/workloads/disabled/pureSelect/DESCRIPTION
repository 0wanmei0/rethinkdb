echo "In this benchmark, we drive the database with a select-only workload. During the benchmark, data gets randomly selected from a database containing 50 million keys, each with a corresponding value size of 8-128 bytes."
echo ""
echo "[h]Rationale[/h]"
echo "Read-only performance is significant for a wide range of applications, specifically those which perform no or only occasional changes to the data set while accessing existing data for reads frequently."

echo "[h]Notes about the results[/h]"
echo "Due to the large cache size used in this benchmark (32GB), most of the data has been loaded into memory within roughly the first 30 seconds. From that point on, it are the in-memory index structures and query processing capabilities which determine the throughput actually available to the user."
echo "Both MySQL and RethinkDB provide high througput rates of more than 1200k queries per second, with a steady througput of 1500k qps for RethinkDB. Membase on the other hand is unable to achieve more than about 250k qps under this workload."
echo "Please note that (as in all benchmarks) we use prepared statements for MySQL to minimize the overhead of SQL query parsing. Both RethinkDB and Membase are accessed through the Memcached text protocol, which comes with comparably low parsing overhead out of the box."
