echo "[h]Overview[/h]"
echo "The large values benchmark tests \"typical\" database performance for workloads involving values of sizes between 4KB and 64KB (equally distributed across sizes in this range)."
echo "The commands issued are a mixture of reads and writes, and - up to the value size - are equal to the ones used for the canonical workload."
echo "Specifically, the following ratio of command types is used:"
echo "1 delete, 4 updates, 8 inserts, 64 reads"
echo ""
echo "[h]Rationale[/h]"
echo "Database management systems might show different performance charactersistics for a smaller number of large compared to a higher number of smaller values."

echo "[h]Notes about the results[/h]"
echo "Both Membase and RethinkDB provide a mostly stable throughput of around 10k queries per second. The throughput is limited at this rate due to network bandwidth saturation in our benchmarking setup. It therefore does not necessarily reflect the performance limitations of the database itself."
echo "However, this benchmark reveals a performance problem of MySQL for this workload, which only provides a steady throughput of around 4k qps."
